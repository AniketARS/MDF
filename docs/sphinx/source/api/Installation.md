# Installation

## Requirements

Python (>=3.7)

## Installation

```
pip install modeci_mdf
```
## Additionally

To generate generate Graph images in MDF you require Graphviz which uses dot.

```
pip install graphviz
```
To render the generated DOT source code, you also need to install [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/) ([download page](https://www.graphviz.org/download/), [installation procedure for Windows](https://forum.graphviz.org/t/new-simplified-installation-procedure-on-windows/224).

Make sure that the directory containing the dot executable is on your system's PATH (sometimes done by the installer; setting PATH on [Linux](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14637979/how-to-permanently-set-path-on-linux-unix), [Mac](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22465332/setting-path-environment-variable-in-osx-permanently), and [Windows](https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm).
